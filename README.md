# project1

Principles that this project is based on is 

1. Disengage - we are losing a battle trying to win in a system setup for us to fail, with their education, symbols, language, religion etc.

2. Policy - implement a policy such as a buddy system. Value each other more than gold itself so we carry ourselves with self-love and we protect our community like our own.

3. Strategize - figure out how to successfully implement the policy in our communities and gather the skills of everyone within our communities in a database so we can know who can help with what.

4. Organize - build infrastructure like what we are all doing now.

5. Re-engage - observe and adapt with our new lens and with our own system within the system that insulates us from prior pitfalls.

We reiterate and make upgrades the same as an operating system and communities adopt whatever changes necessary as they see fit.

# NGHBR-

Principles that this project is based on is 

1. Disengage - we are losing a battle trying to win in a system setup for us to fail, with their education, symbols, language, religion etc.

2. Policy - implement a policy such as a buddy system. Value each other more than gold itself so we carry ourselves with self-love and we protect our community like our own.

3. Strategize - figure out how to successfully implement the policy in our communities and gather the skills of everyone within our communities in a database so we can know who can help with what.

4. Organize - build infrastructure like what we are all doing now.

5. Re-engage - observe and adapt with our new lens and with our own system within the system that insulates us from prior pitfalls.

We reiterate and make upgrades the same as an operating system and communities adopt whatever changes necessary as they see fit.


As or right now the app will consist of Signal API, Guerrilla Mail API and a map api that will allow us to pin businesses owned by our community and if possible to alert red zones if we were pulled over  unjustly and did not feel safe

These 3 features will be the foundation of the app and the problems they will solve is protecting our data and communication channels and helping us retain more of our wealth as we have spending power of $1 Trillion but we spend 98% outside of our community 

So database of businesses owned by our community will give us exposure to help us keep the dollar in our community longer than a few hours as it is now.

The next feature would be a payment system which we would have to figure out the best way to integrate that into the app
